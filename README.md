## :scroll: Description
Easy Countdown Timer in single screen.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This app was created during [Android Dev Challenge](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/android-dev-challenge-2.html).
UI is written fully in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Some UI elements such as infinite scrolling time picker are developed from scratch.

The app design is inspired by an app template from dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/7077105-Daily-UI-challenge-014-Countdown-Timer/
